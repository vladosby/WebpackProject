 * The element you were trying to find wasnâ€™t in the DOM when your script ran.
 * The position of your DOM-reliant script can have a profound effect upon its behavior.
 * The document is parsed from top to bottom. Elements are added to the DOM and scripts are executed as they're encountered.
 * This means that order matters. Typically, scripts can't find elements which appear later in the markup because those elements haven't yet been added to the DOM.
